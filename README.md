## Summary

This project solidified things I have learned with JacaScript, specifically targeting elements within an if statement. This project also gave me a taste of implementing CSS and styling.

There was an instance in making this project where it wasn't working and that situation really put my problem solving skills to the test. I went back and made sure all the spelling was correct and made sure I didn't overlook anything. Through perseverance and patience I was able to debug my code and get it to work.
